        <h1>Hair Dye - What to Use</h1>
        <p>So you're thinking about dyeing your hair a crazy color!    
        </p>
        <h2>Cheaper is not always better</h2>
        <p> Cheap hair dye has a tendency to fade fast! Below are pictures of my
            hair dye after the same amount of time has passed. 
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th colspan="2">Store Bought Dye</th>

        <p>The purple store bought dye looked amazing...until I washed it. With every wash,
           more and more color faded from my hair until it looked almost grey by the end of the month.
        </p>
        <p>The blue salon dye is still going strong, almost 2 months later. The extra money it took to get
           the professional grade dye has paid off in the long run.
