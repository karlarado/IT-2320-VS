    <h1>Hair Dye - What to Use</h1>
    <div class="standard-paragraph">
        So you're thinking about dyeing your hair a crazy color! That's great!
        Beware, though, not all dyes are created equal.

        Cheap hair dye has a tendency to fade fast! Below are pictures of my
        hair dye after the same amount of time has passed.

        The purple store bought dye looked amazing...until I washed it. With every wash,
        more and more color faded from my hair until it looked almost grey by the end of the month.
    </div>
    <div class="standard-paragraph">
        The blue salon dye is still going strong, almost 2 months later. The extra money it took
        to get the professional grade dye has paid off in the long run.
    </div>
    <h2>So you've got your hair dyed at the salon...now what?</h2>
    <div class="standard-paragraph">
        While salon dyes last longer, they too fade. Spending an extra $5 on the bottles in
        your shower can extend the time between salon trips dramatically.
    </div>
    <div class="standard-paragraph">
        Currently, I'm loving
        <a href="https://www.matrix.com/biolage/core/colorlast/colorlast-shampoo">
            Biolage by Matrix's ColorLast
        </a>shampoo. It's a salon brand shampoo at a reasonable price!
    </div>
    <div class="standard-paragraph">
        For conditioner, I've made an amazing discovery in <a href="https://overtone.co/">Overtone!</a>
        With a large range of colors, this amazing product puts dye back into your hair every shower!
        And say goodbye to cold showers, as Overtone works best with warm water!
